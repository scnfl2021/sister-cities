Sister Cities League Website (Static)
  
FILES:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

HOW TO HOST ON GITHUB PAGES (quick):
1) Create a new GitHub repo (public is easiest), e.g. sister-cities
2) Upload these three files to the repo root
3) Repo Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main / (root)
4) Wait ~1 minute and GitHub will give you the URL.

HOW TO UPDATE:
- Edit script.js data (seasons / stats) and push changes. The site updates automatically.

LOGOS (later):
- Add image files in an /assets/ folder, then update script.js to point each team to an image.
